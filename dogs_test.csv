I will bear all the charges for her medical fees and whatever cost at the vet. I also plan to vaccinate and have her neutered when the time is right.

If you are planning to adopt any mixed breed (local breed) dogs. Please, please, please be a responsible dog owner and neuter or spay them as soon as they are old enough to undergo the procedure when they are 4 months or older. There are too many unwanted strays and puppies out there and most do not get a chance in life and are put down. Local dogs are also very resilient and intelligent and they will guard your house well. But please do not chain or cage them unnecessary for a long periods of time as all dogs need to be able to move around and have their exercise. If you love them, they will love you back even more. UPDATE 10 May : Lucy has just given birth to 7 puppies 2 days ago. They are all up for adoption. She has 6 brown/tan cute puppies (like the color of their mommy) and 1 adorable white (female) one. There are 5 female puppies and 2 male puppies in total. Vet said she can offer a special price for spaying/neutering if you are willing to bring the puppy back to her clinic for the procedure. If you are hesitant to adopt a female puppy or unsure about the cost of spaying, please feel free to contact me and we can discuss or work something out together. Please do not hesitate to inquire if you need more information. You can ""book"" the puppies now if you are really interested. They can be adopted once they are weaned from their mommy at about 6-8 weeks. These puppies need a loving and caring home. If you would like to adopt a loving pet into your home, please consider these puppies. Thanks! UPDATE 15 May : Vet said Lucy is taking care of her puppies very well. She is a very good mommy. On closer oservation, there are 2 dark coffee colored puppies, 2 latte puppies, 2 tan puppies (like their mommy) and 1 white puppy. The tiniest puppy of the lot (tan) is also a female. UPDATE 26 MAY : Puppies are about 18 days old now and their eyes are opened already :) Very cute and chubby! One sad news, vet called today to inform me that the tiniest one has passed away. She did not make it because she was wounded unintentionally by one of her siblings, too weak and didn't really want to nurse. My heart aches to know this but at least the consolation is that she did not suffer much and has now joined other beloved pets at 'rainbow bridge'. Farewell little miss tiny. UPDATE 31 MAY : Lucy and her puppies are still at the vet's clinic. Lucy is not trained but I believe she is smart enough and has a lot of potential. Some people have asked what kind of ""mixed breed"" Lucy and her pups are. Lucy is actually a local dog (the common kind) and her size is slightly smaller than a medium framed dog. Since I am unsure about the pups' father, I would assume it was another local dog as well. If you would like more information, please contact me directly. Thanks.",223157063,30.0,Misc

For several months now, my wife and I are looking after this lovely male dog which is “residing” at the beach volleyball field behind the hockey stadium in Bukit Jalil. When we first met Black, he was doing fine. He was looked after by the security guard at the place and Black in return did some occasional work by assisting the guard in his duties. For some undisclosed reason however, someone decided to turn the quite and nice area into a new to build car park. From that time, Black is in trouble. They took away his shelter and subsequently they terminated the services of the security guard, leaving Black with no place to stay and nobody to look after him. Several times per week my wife and I are feeding him, bathing him and see that he is alright but we noticed that the place becomes more and more invaded by more stray dogs who are chasing and harassing Black. The reason for this is that Black is used to humans and therefore in some way social and friendly, giving other dogs the chance to dominate him. At the moment he is under the professional care of Dr. See and his team in Sri Petaling for a severe infected wound at his back. Black don’t deserves this! If you have any idea or solution, please contact me on my mobile phone Hope for the best.Norbert Mohnen",87db66a72,1.0,Misc

We found her near CIMB Jln Ipoh, desperately trying to cross a very busy 3-lane street. We've taken her to the vet and she had to get her tail docked due to a wound caused by a rubber-band that was tied there for too long. She has also been dewormed, but NOT vaccinated yet as she's too young. According to the vets, Caramel is about 8-weeks old. We'd love to keep her, but we just took in another male puppy 3-weeks ago, and since we live in a townhouse-style building we can't handle another pup at the moment. Right now the only way to keep things under control is to keep her in a cage, and we hate to see her cooped up all day. She's an absolute sweetheart and deserves to be with a loving family.

The students from my college called me on Sunday morning to help rescue the dog about a year old doggie, his name is Potato (Cantonese). My students said that the dog is very good natured, very playful and protective of the girls, they took care of him since he was a pup where they hid him from the MPPP that shot and killed Potato’s mum. My students told me someone beat up and threw bleached at him and his eyes were all inflamed before CNY. Before that, there have been incidents where someone tied a plastic bag over his head and people threw hot water at him. And the worse was on Saturday night, they found Potato tied up with a snooze made from fishing line, thrown into the big garbage bin but some auntie came and told the students about the incident and my students climbed into the bin to save him. Because of lack of blood circulation from the snooze, his paws were all swollen and his neck too. He was very lucky my students saved him in time and they took care of him the whole night. I cannot imagine how evil some people can be! Monsters!!!!! I just can’t stop crying to think that this doggie was so badly treated by those ‘animals’ Potato deserves a better life than being tortured… My students can’t keep Potato because they are only renting rooms and the landlady was so mad, she threatened to call the M.P.P.P to come kill Potato on Monday. My students couldn’t stop crying because they will have to go back to their hometowns for the semester break and were afraid that the landlady will hurt Potato so they have asked me to help, I took Potato home. However the house that I've placed the puppies at, my friend’s parents found out and my friend backed out on loaning out his compound (eventhough it’s vacant!) and I have no place to house Potato by end of next week. Fortunately my cousin said he could put Potato in a cage in one of the store rooms but only for like max early next month. Taking him to S.P.C.A is not an option because after what he has been through, I would never take him there and I’m hoping someone good can adopt him. Potato is a wonderful dog, I’ve played with him these few days, we go for walks (I have to tie all my other dogs up, they are very aggressive towards him) and Potato is so loving, at first he was weary but then now he seems better and more willing to trust me and I can’t stop crying on how cruel and evil people can be to treat a sweet dog like him that way… We would give him all the immunity shots by next week at the vet because he had maggots on him from wounds and my vet gave him vitamin, calcium and antibiotic shots on Monday. I hope if you could help please please try to find someone to adopt Potato? I really hope he could find a loving owner because he deserves that after all that he has been through. I really would like to keep him but because I have so many dogs, they don’t respond well to another male dog and knowing Potato’s past, I know I can’t possibly give him a good loving home by being overwhelmed and I’m afraid that he will be badly bullied by my dogs here. I’m just so tired with human nature and their mentality of hurting innocent animals such as Potato.""

According to the vet, Conan might have met with an accident around 4 weeks ago. Both his knee caps' bones were shattered during the accident. Because no-one attend to him then, the wound did not heal properly and the bones actually grew ""abnormally"" which now cause him unable to stretch his 2 back legs. Therefore, when he walks, his two back legs look like as if he is crawling. Otherwise, he is a healthy 1 year old dog. The vet said that he is in no pain and can live like a normal dog but just that he would not be able to walk properly. Appealing to the public to help give Conan a home as we would not want him to end up on the road again. We are sure with his condition, he is sure to be bullied by other dogs. We want him to have another chance to live on despite his disability to walk like a normal dog. If he could survive through the pass 4 weeks, we are sure it's a sign that he don't want or not willing to give up his life so easily.

Hence, the name Yat Yat (meaning 'one one' in Cantonese). Based on the dog's condition when it was found, it was believed to have been abandoned by its heartless owner. The dog suffered from a severe inflammation of the ear where the ear canals are almost completely closed. It also has mange. This obviously neglected dog was sent to the vet for treatment and is currently under the care of my uncle. However, my uncle is only willing to foster it for about a month. Therefore, if I am not able to find an adopter before the deadline, I would have to put this poor dog to sleep. This is the last thing that I want to do as this dog is really well-behaved, very friendly and seemed so innocent, not knowing what its future would be. Yat yat is also partially blind due to cataract. Despite this, he still looks very happy with its life, wagging its tail whenever he hears someone (anyone) nearby although he cannot see. He would also reach his hand out and try to touch us although it doesn't know exactly where we are. I hope that a true animal lover who is willing to care for this dog with all his/her heart would adopt this lovely dog. Yat Yat had suffered enough to have fall into the hands of such owner. Hopefully, its next owner would be a much better one. If you think you are that person, kindly contact me asap! Thank u! ** Yat Yat would be passed to the new owner once it has fully recovered from the otitis (inflammation of the ear) and mange. Here are some details about Yat Yat after I got to know him:- LIKES - a small little house with cozy blanket (so my uncle made him a little house with a cardboard box. He stays in there most of the time) - canned food (can also mix dog biscuit with canned food) - marking territory (lifts up his leg to pee although his tank is already empty) - wrestle with the rug or anything soft (e.g. soft toy) - to play tug-of-war - humping people's legs (can be distracted by giving him the rug to wrestle with) DISLIKES - being caged up (he's pretty quiet when allowed to roam free BUT once he is in a cage or chained up, he will start to protest by barking loudly) ** So preferably no caging! ** - rabbits (he bit my rabbit but luckily no serious injury)",8825893db,14.0,Toy

After all the x-rays, clearly it has suffered a broken backbone, most likely due to the impact from a hit and run event as it's quite severe. This caused him to be partially paralyzed.

Both of us are unable to adopt him as we are both working and have hectic schedules. I am in the IT and the nature of my work is extremely hectic. Hence I am sure I will not have the time to take good care of him. We love dogs, and we refuse to put it to sleep at the time being at least until Monday.

Once we got to know Harry better, we gave him shelter and fed him as well. We found him to be a great guard dog whenever he is in the compound. Harry is docile and obedient, yet alert and watchful for strangers. He roams freely around the house's outer compound and does not make a mess. Harry loves to be around kids and the neighbours are friendly with him. He enjoys walks with the children and running with us when we go for our jogs. Due to his close proximity with us in the neighborhood, we got Harry vaccinated, neutered and dewormed. He is also regularly bathed and checked for fleas. The neighbour's kids would regularly clip his nails/claws and play with him. Harry takes dog biscuits and real meaty treats. Our neighbors are mostly with dogs or cats, a mix of different races and all with irregular working times. As we are worried for his well-being and safety, we have all agreed that Harry deserves a permanent home and a family who can care for him full time. We believe that Harry will make a great family dog and companion to his future owner. He would love an adopter with sufficient space to move around, someone to take him for walks and the occasional tummy rubs when possible. For those who would like to adopt Harry, do visit my profile and contact me through it. We will provide you with his harness, collar and leash for no extra charge :)",6f5c2fe62,4.0,Misc

He is eating good but he still need time to regain his weight. He is very tame, active and eager for care and love. With all blessing, I sincerely hope someone can help Bobby by adopting him. All initial cost of reallocating him/food or etc can be sponsor by me. Please help Bobby and contact me. Many Thanks Vincent Leong",452addaa7,8.0,Misc

My father offered to foster and eventually adopted her into his pack. Ruby's profile can be viewed here - ). Along with my dad’s dogs, I personally have a one-year puppy myself - Daisy Mae, making it a total of 4 dogs, and 12 cats I have under my care. We've been rescuing strays for as long as we can remember, and somehow, we've always found room for one more. My temporary solution in attempt to keep the family together was to continue to pay rent for my dad’s place so that his dogs would still have a home. Rental alone, not inclusive food and necessities for the dogs cost RM1, a month. On an average, with food and necessities, it probably easily sums up to RM/RM, and sometimes RM a month. While I’ve always believed that money can always be earned again, it’s also a hefty sum to cough out on a monthly basis for 3 dogs alone. My dad’s landlord is also keen on taking back the house, and have it rented out to new tenants. With that said, the clock is ticking for me. I have only until the end of February to look for new homes, or a solution for Gigi, Bobby, and Ruby. What I ideally want is to have these dogs under my care, because they were my dad’s babies. He loved them to bits. His whole life was about them - he took care of them exactly like his own children. When he saw that I was cooking for my pets, he did the same - he would cook for them and when he couldn’t, he would lavishly treat them to packets of chicken rice, fruits, and all sorts. Sometimes, their meals are even more lavish than his own. Gigi was his little princess. She was the first of the pack, adopted at about 6 months old. Everywhere my dad went, Gigi was right behind him. She’s very loyal and protective. Every night without fail, she would take her spot right beside my dad on his bed - sleeping only when he sleeps. She would occasionally try to steal kisses and belly rubs from my dad before bedtime. If my dad pretends to be asleep, she would nudge him repeatedly until he finally gives in, and gives her the belly rubs she wanted. Gigi is also very demanding in her own little adorable ways - she wouldn’t let my dad stay past his bedtime, and if my dad had visitors around, she would bark to remind him that bedtime was near. She wouldn’t take no for an answer. If he ignores her, she would continue to bug him until he gives up and goes to bed. Bobby is just a gentle old-soul. He had a family prior to this, and he lost his way one day. By fate, he ended up in front of my dad’s house. In the beginning, my dad didn’t want to take Bobby in, but because Bobby never left (he wandered the streets but every night, he would faithfully return to my dad’s house and slept right outside the gate) my dad eventually decided to adopt him two weeks later. We then found out that Bobby was fearful of many things, especially when you hold up certain objects in front of him - he would retreat with his head hung low, somewhat afraid that he might be hit. We suspected that he had been abused before. But my dad believed that there was nothing love and patience cannot cure, and he was right. In time, Bobby grew accustomed to him and trusted him (and Gigi) as his family. My dad’s life changed tremendously with the presence of Gigi and Bobby. Life was simple, but it was just so cheerful and so full of love. We’ve never been rich, and on some days, we had little to spare, but my dad had his ways, and he made sure that his fur kids were well taken care off. During the last few months of my dad’s life, he was in and out of the hospital for quite a bit, and each time he got admitted, the first thing he would do is to remind me to take good care of his children - to make sure that they are well fed, and are okay at home. Even as he was hooked up on all sorts of machines, he would think about them and about their well being, despite all the pain and discomfort he experienced. As I’m writing this right now, I feel so incredibly guilty and helpless for not being able to protect and preserve the most important ‘people’ in my dad’s life. But at the same time, I’m aware that realistically, I’m not able to make drastic changes in my life and get a bigger space that can accommodate 4 dogs under one roof. Presently, the space that I have just isn’t big enough to have everyone together, and I do not have animal-loving people as neighbours (which makes things even more difficult). So here I am, humbly seeking for your kindness and understanding, to know how much this means to me, and how important it is that I find good homes for my father’s dogs because I am unable to take care of them myself. I’m opened to trial adoptions, temporary fosterings - anything that can help in helping me find a new family for these loving fur kids. If you know of anyone who is interested/can help, I'd appreciate if you could please help spread the word. Thank you. *Gigi (female), Bobby (male), and Ruby (female) are spayed/neutered. *They are flexible as indoor and outdoor dogs. *We're not too sure of Gigi and Bobby's age - but as a rough estimate, they are about 6 - 8 years old. UPDATE 6 JULY - Bobby has passed away.",36d94f9cb,6.0,Misc

This poor furbaby had been through hell with a broken front right leg, two operations and three rods inserted. Now that our rescued Ubu has recovered, he is seeking for a forever home. Ubu is a sweet tempered and playful 1+ yo young dog. Despite his loving nature, he would serves as a good guard dog as he only barks at strangers or other dogs who come too close to the house gate. Otherwise, he barely makes a sound. Ubu is also very obedient and intelligent. He understand that he needs to go into the cage when fosterer drives out without being told or leashed. He is also toilet trained. He pees and poos only on grass but does not do so in house. So unless you have grassy compound, Ubu would need to be walked twice a day for nature calls. He is not aggressive and can be unleashed at parks as he will not attack other dogs, human/children. He would however show signs of resentment by growling if other dogs come too close. Most importantly, he is very friendly, safe and tolerant with rough toddlers. We hope you could give Ubu Wong Choy a chance to love and be loved.

He was registered in Batu Caves, but was found abandoned in Kepong. The second owner took him in and fostered him in Seri Kembangan until he had his newborn child, and he no longer could keep pets due to his child, so I took him in and cared for him, I wanted to make him mine. When I took him in, I was running my own business so I had the luxury and time to care for him and provided him the best place a dog could wish for - a big garden with other dogs to run round and play with. This big garden wasn't mine, but a good friend's garden. Unfortunately, one day he injured his eye, and his right eye is % blind. Things didn't go well for all of us last year, I lost my business, my good friend moved out and Peri now stays in a 2 X 6 feet laundry area in my unit. I work long hours at the office and after office hours to repay my debt that I accumulated. I appeal to the future owner of Peri to please care for him for the rest of his life. As I feel that I am imprisoning such a beautiful dog that all he wants is a belly rub and a lovely owner to play with him, which I cannot afford to provide currently. Peri's personalities. >Smart >Loyal >Obedient >Very very Manja (can sleep beside you the whole night or when you’re watching a movie giving him his belly rub without moving) He loves belly rubs! He can run around in circles before he jumps on the sofa, only to flip over and ask for a belly rub which I guarantee you cannot resist giving. He loves a shower and being groomed. Not spoilt when it comes to food either. I feed him doggie biscuits and he is absolutely fine with it. He is very quiet. He only howls when he hears the police siren, other than that, very friendly with other dogs but funnily afraid of cats! He knows how to sit, give paw, in(to go into his crate),come and leave it commands. When I adopted him, he already knew how to sit and, give paw when there is food. I thought him the leave it,in, come command in 3 X 15 mins sessions, that’s how smart he is. Very easy to train! He loves his walks. I walk him from time to time when I have time. Very easy to walk and won't go after other dogs and provocations. To the future owner, if you wish to adopt him, I really hope that this will be the last owner change for Peri.

She was probably little more than a year old, heavily pregnant, and living off scraps from a nearby hawker stall and goodies that people doing their shopping would buy for her. She wasn’t very keen to come home with us – she preferred to keep humans at a safe distance back then – but we managed to persuade her with some chicken pieces. She promptly vomited these up over me, my husband and the back seat of his company car on the drive home. A week later Laika gave birth to five beautiful puppies in a sunny corner of our home. She was still very wary of both me and my husband but she needed our help with her puppies and gradually started to trust us. She was a wonderful mother and was constantly looking after and looking out for her five energetic and demanding babies. With the help of the PAWS network in Miri we were able to find five good homes for the puppies, but Laika stayed on with us. This wasn’t a straightforward decision. We already had a dog and two cats and we thought carefully about the repsonsibility and cost of taking on another pet when we were certain our future would involve further travel and postings abroad in different countries. We didn’t know Laika’s background but her wariness around people and an injury on her front paw suggested she hadn’t had an easy start to life. But she had come to trust and depend on us and we had grown very attached to her. With her puppies rehomed and her mothering responsibilities over we got to know Laika better. She liked to go for walks and adapted quickly to walking in a harness and on a leash, but she loved being off the leash and running along the local beach, usually at quite amazing speeds. She loved being around us and would sit quite happily at our feet while we worked or watched TV or follow us around the house from room to room. She loved being stroked, especially on her tummy. You could fuss over her for hours and she wouldn’t get bored. And she loved food and was always a little worried about where the next meal was coming from or whether she could gobble up her dinner before someone else got to it. She got along well with our cats and, after a few disagreements over food, became friends with our other dog. She is still sometimes a little unnerved by sudden movements or excited squeals from our three year old daughter, but this has never caused us any significant concern. We also learned that she didn’t like loud noises or crowds and would pull out her harness if we came across a large group of children playing in the street. She became very nervous if people approached her on the street and it took time for visitors to the house to gain her trust. She was completely disinterested in playing ball or fetching sticks. She only chewed things when she was stressed or upset. After our first long holiday apart from her we came home to find an apologetic pet minder and the contents of the bottom row of our bookshelf in shreds on the rug. She’d demonstrated her displeasure at being left behind by chewing her way through half of the complete works of Charles Dickens. And we’d never got round to reading them first. We are heartbroken that we may lose Laika from our family. Although she is healthy and active, New Zealand Bio Security has denied her entry to the country because she has tested positive to having had Babesia Gibsoni (a variety of tic fever) at some time in her life. Even though the tests show she has fully recovered, the fact that she had it in her past, is enough to bar her from entry into NZ or Australia. We are having the tests repeated to ensure there was no mix up in the samples and are still hoping against hope that there may be some way around this problem, but are preparing ourselves for the worst. We would love to find Laika a loving home if we are unable to take her with us. She is a wonderful pet. She is loving and loyal and the perfect companion and will be your loving shadow when you are with her. As I write this she is curled up behind my chair and if I whisper her name I will receive an answering flick or two from her tail. Please help. I have never been more attached to a dog or more sure that she will bring huge joy to anyone who can offer her a loving home. Sarah Rees",03d14e004,2.0,Misc

It was rainy season so we rescued them in fear that they might drown. The pictures shown were taken when they got their first vaccination at the vet. At the time, they were only 2.5 months old (verified by the vet). They may not seem like it because of their larger size, the vet believes they may be from a bigger breed. They are now 3 months old and I think it would be nice for them to have a new family that they can bond with from this early age. I have tried to get them neutered and spayed, but no vet would do it as they are too young. If you are looking for additional family members, please consider them. They are easily trained, very smart and listen well. Bear in mind though, they are still puppies. They like to play a lot but very manja at the same time. They must be adopted together. They know their names and will come when called. They know the commands ""sit"", ""down"" and ""off"". They play fetch the ball too! My conditions are: 1. Landed house with a patch of grass (for their toilet), with secured fencing so the puppies do not escape. They are not suitable for apartments. 2. Adopter has a chance for a trial period of 2 weeks. If the adopter feel the puppies are not a good match with their family, they can return after the trial period. At the same time, if I feel the adopter and puppies are not good match, I will have the right to reclaim them. This is to ensure both adopter and puppies will be happy in the long term, as this is a lifelong commitment. 3. Adopter must provide good food (they eat meatdust and sometimes kibbles) and water that is changed daily. 4. Adopter must provide a living space that is humane, not too hot and has shelter from the sun and rain. The dogs must not be caged and not tied up for long periods of time. 5. Adopter must promise to complete the 2nd and 3rd monthly vaccination (1st has been done by me) and then once yearly. If this happens during trial period, I will pick them up and get it done. 6. Confirmed adopter must promise to spay/neuter the puppies when they are 5 months old. If there is a problem, contact me and I will help you get this done and I will bear the cost. At this time, the puppies are cared for by a relative and so I apologize it is not possible to visit them. But I can bring them to you if you'd like to meet them.

She is very smart, I taught her how to fetch in only one day and she grasped it fast (as shown in video). She is dauschund-husky mix, very small build, but tall. Her owner was a neighbor who moved back to their homecountry, Korea. So I offered to take care of her till I can find her a new family. She is better suited for a family with landed property with a grass patch (she does her toilet business on grass), and with another young dog to play with. She can easily get lonely without another dog or person to play with, and sometimes her anxiety leads to not eating. She's a dog trainer's dream come true because she is very eager to learn and she does learn fast, with treats as motivator. If you are looking for a young dog who is matured enough and can easily be moulded through training from young, she is the one. Unfortunately I do not have the time to bring out the best in her. Choco is vaccinated, microchipped, spayed and dewormed and professional grooming. Adopter will be given her Pet Passport with her microchip serial number and medical details.

This is because I want to make sure the family and dog will match. If the trial period passes successfully, the adopter must allow me to visit (with prior appointment) a few times till both sides are happy.

Tag loves his toys, and is up for a game of fetch even when half asleep. He is also a huge fan of car rides. Tag is a VERY loved dog.

She is, however, very protective once she acknowledges you and is an extremely good guard dog, she has got a good strong bark and listens to commands relatively well. You can walk her off leash after she has gotten used to you and the surrounding (at guarded areas and only if the people in your area are fine with it). We were originally thinking of keeping her for ourselves but we've already got a handful from our current dog, so we wish to find her a happier home where she can run free in or out.

She is a sweet dog, great with children, undemanding and easy to maintain (she doesn't require grooming). She is an outdoor (yard) dog. She is trained to pee and poop only outside once a day on a walk. She isn't destructive. She's a great house ""alarm"" - very alert when strangers pass by, but has never bitten anyone (barks but doesn't advance to attack). Before her adoption in , she was an abused pup (abused by people and other dogs). She hides and is very timid when new people approach her. Therefore, it takes a few weeks for her to ""come out of her shell"" with new company, in a new environment. Once she becomes comfortable and trusts her new family, she is very friendly, playful and loving. Sadly, we need to put her up for adoption because we have moved into a condo which doesn't allow pets. Bailey has been a huge blessing to us as a family. She is great around young children (my youngest is 4 now, in total we have 4 kids under 11), she has never jumped on them or nipped them. They can touch her, pull her, grab her , hug her and stroke her without resistance. She has a very calm disposition. If your heart is big enough to accept and adopt an abused dog who just needs some extra patience and love in the beginning, you will be greatly rewarded by her doggy love and friendship! Currently, she is fed once a day, a bowl of kibble. When she lived with us, she was on a % RAW diet with no problems. As we have moved, we have brought Bailey to live with her original Fosterer.
